ocamlculator
============

A little attempt at enhancing the classical example of a calculator in OCaml.

Although making a simple calculator in OCaml is really easy, we'll try here to go a little further, e.g. compute

floating-point values, and cross-bases calculus.

A graphical user interface would then be great, maybe in GTK.
